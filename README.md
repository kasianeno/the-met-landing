<strong>DESCRIPTION</strong>

Creating a well-crafted landing page project is an essential exercise for web developers, combining fundamental web development skills to create a visually appealing and functional web page. This project typically involves designing a single-page website that serves as the first impression for visitors, showcasing a product, service, or personal brand. 

That landing page is responsive, ensuring it looks good on various devices like desktops, tablets, and smartphones. Key elements include a header with a striking headline, descriptive sections that highlight features such as exploring exhibition gallery guides, online exploring, even more, aside panel, which contain navigation for all sections. Bottom section contain contact information and a simple form to left your own message. Footer include only image as a part of a design.

In terms of CSS, i desided to use SCSS preprocessor for minimalize code length, use mixins for device adaptabillity and make css files be more clear. The project will involve using various styling techniques such as flexbox or grid layouts to arrange content, hover effects for interactive elements, and transitions or transformations to add dynamic aspects to the page. The use of consistent color schemes, typography, and imagery will also play a crucial role in maintaining brand identity and ensuring a cohesive design.

Overall, that landing page project is an opportunity to demonstrate my skills in creating a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing web experience, with a focus on effective information acquisition and user engagement.
